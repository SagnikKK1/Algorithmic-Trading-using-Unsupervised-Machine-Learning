# Clustering-Based Algorithmic Trading on S&P 500

## Project Overview

This project aims to implement and analyze the performance of clustering techniques and technical indicators in the context of algorithmic trading on the S&P 500 index. By identifying patterns and groupings in historical price data, we develop a trading strategy to capitalize on predictive insights provided by our model followed by Portfolio Optimisation to beat the benchmark returns by a considerable margin.

## Features

- **Clustering Algorithms**: Detailed implementation of K-Means clustering technique on diferent technical indicators like RSI,ATR along with application of predefined centroids to segment S&P 500 stocks based on historical performance,liquidity and price movement patterns.
- **Trading Strategy**: Development of a rule-based trading strategy leveraging the clusters to make predictions about future price movements.
- **Portfolio Optimisation**:Using Portfolio Optimisation techniques to calculate ideal weights for stocks.

## Getting Started

Please download the Jupyter Notebook and run through the notebook to replicate the results.

### Prerequisites

List all libraries and tools needed to run the project:
- Python 3.11
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Relevant Python packages: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `yfinance` for market data; `pypfopt` for Portfolio Optimisation

### Results

The project includes a detailed analysis with visualizations of the strategy's performance and comparison with the S&P 500 benchmark. The results are promising and can be converted into a product in the future with further improvements.
